#### Course Description:
This course explores the fundamentals of storytelling through sequential image making. The focus is to introduce students to a variety of animation techniques, vocabulary, tools and history. Students will create three potential portfolio pieces while learning the basics of Stop Motion, Adobe Photoshop, Premiere and After Effects— to create, digitize and animate artwork.

#### Course Requirements:
Students are expected to participate in class: contributing to class discussions, giving other students constructive feed back, arriving on time having thoughtfully completed the reading, technical and creative assignments. Computers and mobile devices must be silenced and not glowing during critique, in class screenings, technical demonstrations, class discussion and student presentations.

It is your responsibility to turn in work on time, to make up any missed assignments, and to catch up with the class in the event of an absence. Late work is unacceptable; however, this work can be turned in for partial credit. If you know you are going to be absent, contact the professor by email in advance.

You are required to maintain a blog for this class. This is where you will post your homework assignments to then link to our class wiki. Think of it like a digital sketchbook - the blog is not meant to be a finished portfolio site, but a place for your creative process and works in progress.

Drawing skills are not necessary for this class, however, students are required to keep a sketchbook, and bring it to class every week. Each student should sketch, storyboard or write in their sketchbook daily. Students should bring an external storage device with them to class every week.

#### “Share” (or the class Wiki):
The [class wiki](https://github.com/rebleo/i2daSummer2018/wiki) is where the rest of the syllabus including each day's resources, in-class and take-home assignments will be found. To turn in your homework you must link to it every day on the class wiki. You are required to post on the wiki. To contribute to the wiki you must set up a [Github](http://www.github.com) account. We will do this in class on the first day.

---
#### Blog:
Students will be asked to share images or videos as a means to turn in homework assignments. Students should set up and maintain a personal blog for this purpose. There are many free options that will offer you enough storage space for the semester. I suggest [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) or [Medium](https://medium.com/) but choose whatever platform you prefer.

##### Attendance:
Two (unexcused) absences result in grade drop and four absences result in a failing grade. Late or early departure from class (15 minutes) is the equivalent of ½ absence.

###### To earn an A 
All class work and homework is excellent. Projects have been completed when assigned. The work shows a development and understanding of the principles discussed in class. It is presented immaculately. There is regular and prompt attendance and participation during critiques and an enthusiasm toward the material being presented throughout the semester. This is exceptional work.

###### To earn a B 
All assigned work completed in a thorough manner. An understanding of the principles and lessons covered in class is evident. The student comes to class regularly and on time and participates in critiques and discussions. This is better than average work.

###### To earn a C
